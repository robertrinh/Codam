# CPP Modules
The CPP Modules are a introduction of the C++ language. After a bunch of C projects where we had to code according a norm (f.e. 25 line functions, seperate declarations, custom functions), our wings are set free and we are able to use the libraries to how we see fit. For starters, we are recommended to use C++ standard 98, but we are allowed to use others at a later stage. 

The modules also mention that we have to code in a C++ way and that we have to let go of C-written style code. This to ensure that we are able to understand the potentials of C++ and broadening our knowledge.

## The Modules, in order
Below will be a list of modules that will be completed. Each module teaches us about a new concept and there will be some key learning points from them.

### Module 00: C++ basics
Object: Introduction to basic concepts and syntax of C++.
What did I learn? 
-  Basic syntax of C++ (f.e. `<<` and `::` operators), I/O
-  C++ concepts such as data types, public and private classes, namespaces
-  C++ functions and libraries
