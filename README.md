A list of projects that falls within the 42 curriculum.


In the 42 curriculum, there is a set of projects that is mandatory for students to complete. There are ranks in which you have to complete every project in the rank to level up to the next rank.


Peek for yourself the projects that I have finished and am currently working on :v:

The ranks consists of the following projects:
