# libft ðŸ“š

## Overview

**libft** is the very first assignment of the Codam Curriculum (42 network)! 

The objection of this project is to recreate a set of functions in the standard C library, and several additional functions, which might be part of the C library but in a different form. The goal of the project is to deepen understanding of C programming, improve algorithmic thinking, and master working with low-level memory management.

The focus is on building an efficient and reusable library which we students have to use in the future projects. There are a several functions which are not mandatory, but is added in a later date for my own convenience.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files;
2. Compile the functions with the provided `Makefile` calling `make`
3. When the compilation has succeeded, use various main files to test out the functions ðŸ«°

## Usage

### There are several directories following certain subjects, which consists of the following functions (in alphabetical order):
| Categories | Function |
| ---------- | -------- |
| character checks | `ft_isalnum`, `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isascii`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isprint`, `ft_tolower`, `ft_toupper` |
| ft_printf | project [ft_printf](https://github.com/robertrinh/Codam/tree/main/Rank1/ft_printf) |
| get_next_line | project [get_next_line](https://github.com/robertrinh/Codam/tree/main/Rank1/get_next_line) |
| linked lists (BONUS :star:) | `ft_lstadd_back`, `ft_lstadd_front`,`ft_lstclear`,`ft_lstdelone`,`ft_lstiter`,`ft_lstlast`,`ft_lstmap`,`ft_lstnew`,`ft_lstsize` |
| memory management | `ft_bzero`,`ft_calloc`, `ft_free_2d`, `ft_memchr`, `ft_memcmp`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`, `ft_memset` |
| string manipulation | `ft_atod`, `ft_atoi`, `ft_ayetoi`, `ft_itoa`, `ft_split`, `ft_strchr`, `ft_strdup`, `ft_striteri`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_strlcat`, `ft_strlcpy`, `ft_strlen`, `ft_strmapi`, `ft_strncmp`, `ft_strnstr`, `ft_strrchr`, `ft_strtrim`, `ft_substr` |
| writing functions | `ft_putchar_fd`, `ft_putendl_fd`, `ft_putnbr_fd`, `ft_putstr_fd` |   

All of these functions must be written from scratch.
